	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<p>I will be a very recent college graduate who is generally seeking to make meaningful impacts on my communities. In completing my undergraduate degree in Cartography and GIS, I have realized that I truly love to learn HOW things are done. Cartography and GIS has provided an amazing blank slate to explore different ways of representing and analyzing the world. Expanding upon this, I have also been able to learn a large amount from my engineering and environmental science courses.  Upon completing these courses, I have acquired many diverse skills. These skills include the ability to construct a geographic argument, critical problem solving, and a strong logical thinking. I have become skilled with ArcGIS, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Office, and ENVI. I have also become familiar with Python, MATLAB, and Adobe Photoshop. Leaving university, I want to apply these skills to spatially complex problems. Solving problems that vary across space is one way I can help to contribute both to GIS as a field and the communities I connect with.</p>
